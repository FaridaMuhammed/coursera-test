        <p>Note: Read the time your rice packet suggests for a cooking time. We advise taking the minimum time it suggests, then adding 30 seconds on to it. Fill a pan with 6 cups of water and place on a high heat to bring it to a racing boil. Once the pan is boiling, add your rice and give a short stir immediately, to avoid your rice sticking to the bottom. Let the water come back to boil, then turn the heat down to a medium to high heat and start your timer. Once your time is up fill the remaining space in your pan up with cold water and then pour all the contents into a sieve. Keep cold running water on to your rice, making sure to move the rice around to ensure you stop the cooking process.
